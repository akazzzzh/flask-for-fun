ðŸ”¹ from flask import Flask
You're importing the Flask class from the Flask library.
Flask is the main class used to create your web application.



ðŸ”¹ app = Flask(__name__)
You are creating an instance of the Flask class and naming it app.
__name__ tells Flask where to find templates and static files.
If you're running the script directly, __name__ will be "__main__".



ðŸ”¹ @app.route('/')
This is a decorator.
It tells Flask what URL should trigger the function below it.
'/' is the root URL (i.e., http://localhost:5000/).



ðŸ”¹ def hello():
You define a Python function named hello.
This function will be called when someone visits the root URL.



ðŸ”¹ return "Hello Buddies!"
The function returns a string: "Hello Buddies!".
This string is what gets displayed in the browser when the route is accessed.



ðŸ”¹ if __name__ == "__main__":
This line checks whether your script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
If it is being run directly, then the code inside this block will execute.



ðŸ”¹ app.run(debug=True)
This starts the Flask development web server.
debug=True:
Enables debug mode, which:
Auto-reloads the server when you make code changes.
Shows detailed error messages in the browser.


ðŸ”¸ <label for="Fundamentals of Cryptography"> ... </label>
<label> is used to label an input field.
The for="..." attribute is supposed to match the id of the corresponding <input> element.
This creates an association so when you click the label, it focuses the input box.


ðŸ”¸ <input type="text" name="Fundamentals_of_Cryptography" value="">
This creates a text input field where users can type in their answer.
type="text" â†’ it's a single-line text box.
name="Fundamentals_of_Cryptography":
This is the key used when submitting the form.
Youâ€™ll access it in Flask with:


ðŸ”¹ <link rel="stylesheet" ... >
This tells the browser:
"Link to an external CSS file to style the page."
rel="stylesheet" means this link is a stylesheet (not a favicon, script, etc.)


ðŸ”¹ href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}"
This is Jinja2 templating used in Flask.
It dynamically builds the correct URL path to the CSS file.


ðŸ”¸ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css')
static is a special route in Flask that serves static files (like CSS, JS, images).
filename='css/styles.css' means the file is located at:
